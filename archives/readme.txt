archives is a folder for storing old versions of the simulator or data that has
no immediate use. For the sake of caution I am including them as a folder in

C:\Users\DoubleDanks\BISB\wisser\code\rjwlab_scripts\saegus_project\archives and
will push them to the remote repository. I would rather have them in case there 
happens to be something useful.
