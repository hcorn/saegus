Welcome to the saegus Documentation
===================================

wgs is an extension of the general purpose forward time population genetics
simulation environment simuPOP_. simuPOP is a Python package which
is wrapped around a C++ core using SWIG_. simuPOP supports simulations
with many common population genetics scenarios as well as the capability to
define completely custom scenarios.

wgs is developed for a monothalic plant population *Zea mays*.
Although wgs can be used for any species most of the functionality
is implemented in plant populations. wgs implements several mating
scenarios common in plant breeding such as multi-parent advanced generation
inter-cross *MAGIC*
