   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root
      is saved and used for cross-referencing. The environment is pickled
      after the parsing stage so that successive runs only need to
      read and parse new and changed documents.

   source directory
      The directory and its subdirectories which encompasses a
      single Sphinx project.
