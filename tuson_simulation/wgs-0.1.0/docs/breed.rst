    There are special types of crosses which are used frequently in maize breeding. The Cross collects the functions
    which are the *in silico* equivalents of performing a cross. These crosses are the building blocks of more complex
    mating schemes such as the MAGIC (Multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross).
